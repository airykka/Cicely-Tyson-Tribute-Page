                <p class="intro">Cicely Tyson was an award-winning film, television and stage actress known for playing strong Black leads and refusing to play roles that were demeaning to Black women. The actor has long been considered a force in the entertainment industry, opening doors for many Black professionals to follow. </br></br>

                    Tyson had a well-known commitment to community involvement. She co-founded the Dance Theater of Harlem after Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, and when a school board in East Orange, New Jersey, wanted to name a performing arts school after her, she only agreed to accept the honor if she could participate in school activities. In addition to attending meetings and events, Tyson even taught a master class at the school.

            “I have managed Miss Tyson’s career for over 40 years, and each year was a privilege and blessing. Cicely thought of her new memoir as a Christmas tree decorated with all the ornaments of her personal and professional life. The day she died, she placed the last ornament, a Star, on top of the tree.”</br><span>- Larry Thompson</span>
