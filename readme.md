# Tribute Page For Cicely Tyson

> I recently decided to take the Freecodecamp certification and my first project was to create a Tribute Page that looked like [this one.](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx). This is my own rendition of this project :)

> Some key features that make this Tribute Page stand oout from most that I have seen are the following:

- It is fully responsive, adapting to look great on any screen size.
- It has a simple, yet beautiful UI design.
- Great UX.

> I know, I'm blowing my own trumpet :) but dont take my word for it. You can view my result by [clicking here](https://codepen.io/airykka/full/bGBXOLa) or install it on your local machine by following the steps below.

## Quick Start/Installation

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
* Clone the repo

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/airykka/Cicely-Tyson-Tribute-Page.git
  ```
* Then enter the folder ```Cicely-Tyson-Tribute-Page```

    ```shell
  cd Cicely-Tyson-Tribute-Page
  ```

* Then open the ```index.html``` file in your web browser on your local machine.

* ...and that's it! You should be able to view the HTML & CSS representation of the tribute page.

> Quick Note: I love Cicely Tyson. I believe she did set a great example for many young women both in and outside the entertainment industry. She is worthy of emulation and it's an honor to use her life story for this page.
